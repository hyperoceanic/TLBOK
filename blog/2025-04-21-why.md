There's a lot of excellent material about leading software development teams, usually written by
people who don't work at the code level any more. This web site focuses on the needs of tech
leads who still code.

Carlyle got that right but he was a nasty old racist so let's move on to looking at the practicalities I'm interested in:

## Scope

I'm interested in the scope of work in so far as it affects the ability of my teams to deliver working software, and the extent to which I can influence the entities at different scopes to facilitate delivery.

```pre
Self > Team > Project > Enterprise
```

That is, changes you can make to yourself will directly affect your teams ability to deliver. After that, working on your team pays off. Then the enterprise. Mostly, at any rate. Sometimes there's stuff going on at the enterprise level that blocks progress.

## Duration

```pre
Now > Day > Week > Sprint > Milestone > Initiative > Engagement
```

No prognosticating about possible future develoments, or features that haven't been designed.
